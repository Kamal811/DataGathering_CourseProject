The following are the overall set of steps for the execution logic

1. Set the Activity Names from the subject file
2. Read the training data set into data frame
3. Read the test data set into data frame
4. Merge the training and test files of each type
5. Merged all data with mean and srandard deviations and column names for each observation

The following file contains explanations of various variables used in the system

##**********************Set the Activity Names from the subject file

colActivityNames <- List of activity names as part of readings

##**********************Read the training data set into data frame
X_train <- Training data for X at root
Y_train <- Training data for Y at root
Subject_train <- Training data for subject

body_acc_x_train <- Training data for body acc at x axis
body_acc_y_train <- Training data for body acc at y axis
body_acc_z_train <- Training data for body acc at z axis

##************

body_gyro_x_train <- Training data for body gyro at x axis

##******

total_acc_x <- Merged data for total acc at x  
total_acc_y <- Merged data for total acc at y
total_acc_z <- Merged data for total acc at z 

##******************Merged all data with mean and srandard deviations and column names for each observation

Complete_Mean_StdDev <- Data Frame for the merged mean and standard deviation for each data point
