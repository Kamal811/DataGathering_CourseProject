##Running the code##

The program consists of a set of instructions. 
The instructions are not encapsulated in a function and maintained seperately so that each intermediate step can be evaluated 

For execution, the user must select the set of instructions to be executed and Run the same using the RStudio 

##Important: About the location of the data files##

** All data files must be moved into the same working directory and same folder. 

There should NOT be training or test folders

The code works for a single working directory
